<h1>Marci's Favorite Movies of All Time</h1>
<h2>These are my top three, in no particular order.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Grand Budapest Hotel</h3>
<p>This is one I just keep coming back to. It's beautifully shot, cleverly written, and lightheartedly fun.</p>
<h3>Call Me By Your Name</h3>
<p>I know that for many people, the storyline leaves much to be desired. And I understand that. But I love this movie for its ambience. It really captures a feeling of summer that few other movies have or can.
</p>
<h3>Pride and Prejudice</h3>
<p>I mean, need I say anything? It's a damn classic.</p>
